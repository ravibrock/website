    <br>
    <p>
            First post! I doubt I'll write new ones that often, but I'd been meaning to compile this for a while anyways. This is a brief overview of all the apps and tools I use on a regular basis, inspired by Brian Lovin's post <a href="https://brianlovin.com/stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'll try to keep this page updated as I change my setup, but hopefully that won't be a frequent occurence. I didn't include websites, but a large part of that is because I prefer to use app clients rather than websites whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Update 2/4/23 - Recently stopped using Fig and switched from Hyper to iTerm2. I stopped using Fig because it's closed-source and phones home, and I decided that I'd rather my terminal setup be entirely open-source. I also decided that the amount of configuration iTerm offers made it worth leaving Hyper.</i>
    </p>
    <h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>
    <h3 id="brave"><a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brave</a></h3>
    <p>
        This is my main browser. I went through all the settings and tried to maximize privacy without compromising on day-to-day productivity. I also configured separate profiles for school and personal browsing - good for staying focused.
    </p>
    <h3 id="safari"><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a></h3>
    <p>
        I use a Mac, so this is installed by default, but I only ever use it if a website is broken in Brave.
    </p>
    <h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>
    <h4 id="bitwarden-extension"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a></h4>
    <p>
        Self-explanatory: integrates Bitwarden with my browser.
    </p>
    <h4 id="minimal-theme-for-twitter"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-theme-for-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minimal Theme for Twitter</a></h4>
    <p>
        Makes the Twitter website look a lot cleaner, and allows me to hide UI elements that I&#39;m not interested in.
    </p>
    <h4 id="random-user-agent"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/random-user-agent-switche/einpaelgookohagofgnnkcfjbkkgepnp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random User-Agent</a></h4>
    <p>
        Changes my user-agent in Brave every 5 minutes. Good for anonymization, but requires some customization to ensure that websites serve the correct version of themselves.
    </p>
    <h4 id="ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"UBlock Origin> UBlock Origin</a></h4>
    <p>
        FOSS ad and tracker blocker that I use along with the built-in adblockers in all my browsers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
    <h3 id="discord"><a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></h3>
    <p>
        I just use this to talk to friends. I installed BetterDiscord and the Clearvision theme so that the UI would be darker.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mailmate"><a href="https://freron.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailMate</a></h3>
    <p>
        Mac-only email client. Definitely the best one I&#39;ve tried before, and the first one that caused me to switch away from Apple Mail. Uses IMAP/SMTP for connection, and allows for extensive customization of keyboard shortcuts. Costs $50 for a lifetime key with a 30 day free trial, so not cheap, but still better value than any subscription-based app like Superhuman IMO.
    </p>
    <h3 id="texts"><a href="https://texts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texts</a></h3>
    <p>
        Provides a unified UI and client for almost all of the platforms I use regularly: Twitter/Discord/iMessage/LinkedIn/etc. It supports Instagram, too, but I think it&#39;s picked up by antibot filters since my old account was suspended after having only used it within Texts for a while.
    </p>
    <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
    <h3 id="github-desktop"><a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Desktop</a></h3>
    <p>
        Using Git via the command line works well, but I find that GitHub Desktop is often quicker for simple tasks and going through multiple repos quickly.
    </p>
    <h3 id="iterm2"><a href="https://iterm2.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iTerm2</a></h3>
    <p>
        I switched recently from Hyper to iTerm. It takes longer to configure, but once I finished it looks just as nice as Hyper but with far more powerful settings.
    </p>
    <h3 id=neovim"><a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neovim</a></h3>
    <p>
    I've been using Vim/Neovim more lately to edit files. I put some work into my vimrc (found <a href="https://github.com/ravibrock/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and it's been really nice for quick edits.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pycharm"><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyCharm</a></h3>
    <p>
        JetBrains IDEs are amazing. I use PyCharm for all my Python development, and it works perfectly. Again, not many extensions, though I do use Copilot and the Nord theme.
    </p>
    <h3 id="rstudio"><a href="https://posit.co/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RStudio</a></h3>
    <p>
        My main R IDE. I might switch to using PyCharm for R at some point to reduce the number of apps I use, but RStudio works well and I&#39;m used to it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vscode"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode</a></h3>
    <p>
        My primary text editor that I use for everything except Python and R. I haven&#39;t gone very far down the extensions rabbit hole, though I do have the Microsoft Live Preview extension for writing HTML and the Framer Syntax dark theme.
    </p>
    <h3 id="zsh"><a href="https://www.zsh.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zsh</a></h3>
    <p>
        Zsh is my default shell. I stuck with Fish for a while, but I ended up switching back due to the hassle of converting shell scripts and commands into Fish syntax. I was able to recreate Fish functionality with Zsh extensions anyways.
    </p>
    <h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>
    <h4 id="github-copilot"><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a></h4>
    <p>
        Not much to say other than that Copilot works amazing for me and vastly speeds up development, especially if I&#39;m using a language like HTML that I&#39;m less familiar with. It&#39;s also free for students, which is a nice bonus.
    </p>
    <h4 id="zsh-autocomplete"><a href="https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zsh Autocomplete</a></h4>
    <p>
        My most used Zsh plugin. Fills in old commands based on what I&#39;m currently typing.
    </p>
    <h4 id="zsh-syntax-highlighting"><a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zsh Syntax Highlighting</a></h4>
    <p>
        The other feature from Fish I missed in vanilla Zsh. Custom-configured all the color settings to what&#39;s intuitive for me.
    </p>
    <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
    <h3 id="cron"><a href="https://cron.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cron</a></h3>
    <p>
        Cron is the only calendar app I use. Nothing incredibly unique, but intuitive keyboard shortcuts, a nice UI, solid functionality, and an iOS app. The menu bar calendar is also a nice touch that makes it a lot easier to see my next appointment at a glance.
    </p>
    <h3 id="obsidian"><a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a></h3>
    <p>
        I use Obsidian for all my notes, having switched from Apple Notes a few months ago. I also use it for my to-do list - I could use Todoist or something similar, but it doesn&#39;t feel necessary at the moment and it&#39;s nice having fewer apps. Similar to Notion, but allows me to write all my notes in WYSIWYG Markdown rather than a proprietary file format.
    </p>
    <h3 id="raycast"><a href="https://www.raycast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raycast</a></h3>
    <p>
        Life-changing. The spotlight search itself works well, but by far the biggest productivity boost for me has come from its extensions. I have all the apps I use daily connected to keyboard shortcuts, for example, and it allows me to navigate between apps far faster than having to use the dock.
    </p>
    <h2 id="security-privacy">Security/Privacy</h2>
    <h3 id="assorted-shell-scripts"><a href="https://sunknudsen.com/privacy-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assorted shell scripts</a></h3>
    <p>
        I use a number of shell scripts from Sun Knudsen for things such as <a href="https://sunknudsen.com/privacy-guides/how-to-disable-cups-printer-job-history-on-macos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purging my print history</a> and <a href="https://sunknudsen.com/privacy-guides/how-to-spoof-mac-address-and-hostname-automatically-at-boot-on-macos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatically spoofing my MAC address</a>. Setup is more involved than any of the below options, but they don&#39;t require any maintenance after and help with my peace of mind.
    </p>
    <h3 id="authy"><a href="https://authy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authy</a></h3>
    <p>
        My OTP app. Easy to use and wasn&#39;t created by a company like Google that sells data.
    </p>
    <h3 id="bitwarden"><a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a></h3>
    <p>
        Good password manager: FOSS with the option of self-hosting and integrates well with all my browsers and on my phone. It&#39;s going to be slightly less secure than something with no sync, like KeePassXC, but its history is spotless and the convenience makes it worthwhile for me.
    </p>
    <h3 id="cloudflare-warp"><a href="https://1.1.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Warp</a></h3>
    <p>
        This has mostly replaced VPN usage for me. It keeps my DNS queries private while avoiding the speed reduction from a VPN. Its autoconnection can be spotty, but is easily fixed by toggling it off then on again.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gpg-keychain"><a href="https://gpgtools.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPG Keychain</a></h3>
    <p>
        My FOSS PGP client of choice.  It was easy to set up and configure, and there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/Free-GPGMail/Free-GPGMail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liberated implementation</a> of the Mail plugin (though MailMate has native integration).
    </p>
    <h3 id="mega"><a href="https://mega.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega</a></h3>
    <p>
        My main cloud storage provider. End-to-end encrypted and privacy-focused, with an extremely simple and reliable sync app. I use iCloud for some things, like photos and music, but all my files are stored in Mega.
    </p>
    <h3 id="nordvpn"><a href="https://nordvpn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NordVPN</a></h3>
    <p>
        My VPN that I use for streaming. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for privacy purposes but has fast connection speeds and servers in every country I&#39;ve needed to connect to.
    </p>
    <h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
    <h3 id="activity-monitor"><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity Monitor</a></h3>
    <p>
        I use the default Activity Monitor app fairly regularly to track RAM/CPU usage and make sure nothing is slowing down my computer. Simple UI and does its job well.
    </p>
    <h3 id="amphetamine"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amphetamine</a></h3>
    <p>
        A simple menu bar app for keeping my computer awake. Supports a global keyboard shortcut  for toggling on/off as well as more powerful options like having the computer stay on whenever a certain process is running.
    </p>
    <h3 id="hidden-bar"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden Bar</a></h3>
    <p>
        One other menu bar app that allows me to hide less-used menu bar icons, like Cloudflare Warp, and reveal them with a keyboard shortcut.
    </p>
    <h3 id="iina"><a href="https://iina.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IINA</a></h3>
    <p>
        Great replacement for QuickTime Player. Just as easy to use, but with far more features available should you need them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="logi-options-plus"><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logi Options+</a></h3>
    <p>
        App that Logitech provides for configuring their peripherals. I use it for per-app config of my MX Master 3, which makes the mouse even more powerful than it is by default. Slightly buggy sometimes, but very useful overall.
    </p>
    <h3 id="stats"><a href="https://github.com/exelban/stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stats</a></h3>
    <p>
        I also use the Stats app to check important figures at a glance - its battery menu bar icon is far more detailed than the default battery tracker, and the RAM menu bar icon is also useful.
    </p>
    <h3 id="unnaturalscrollwheels"><a href="https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UnnaturalScrollWheels</a></h3>
    <p>
        Allows me to have my mouse scroll in the opposite direction as my trackpad. Annoying that Apple doesn&#39;t have that as an option by default, but this is a simple workaround.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vercel"><a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a></h3>
    <p>
        I use Vercel to host this website. It automatically pulls changes from the website&#39;s GitHub repo and handles the backend config for me. Not as satisfying as setting it up myself but far simpler and free for personal use - no server costs or buying https certificates.
